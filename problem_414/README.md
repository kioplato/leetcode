[Leetcode: problem 414](https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/description/)

This solution does not accurately solve the problem. My solution
solves this problem: find the third maximum number in a list.
* For example, the third maximum number in the list [4, 2, 6, 1, 5]
  is the number 4.
* Another example is: the third maximum number in the list [2, 2, 3,
  1] is 3 (the first maximum number is 1 and the second maximum
  number is 2).
* Last example: the third maximum number is the list [2, 1, 6, 2, 8,
  3, 5, 4, 3, 9, 7, 6] is 3. It literally finds the third maximum
  number from a list in O(n) complexity.
My variation to the problem definition is more complex and difficult
than the original one, therefore I do not intend to consciously solve
it.
